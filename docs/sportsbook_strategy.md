# Sportsbook Strategy

## Primary and secondary books

- **Betfair Exchange (primary):** No traditional limits; 5% commission on net winnings. Best for sharp action and larger stakes.
- **Pinnacle (secondary):** Sharp-friendly, high limits relative to other books. Use when exchange liquidity is thin.

## Account management

- Sportsbooks flag consistent winners within the first ~10 bets. Spread action across books and avoid betting only the highest-EV lines at one book.
- Prefer Betfair/Pinnacle for core value; use other books for fills and to avoid concentration.

## Market timing

- Place golf bets **Monday–Tuesday** for opening line value when possible; lines move as news and field updates arrive.
