## AI Analysis

**Course Narrative:** Riviera Country Club is a challenging venue that demands precision in ball-striking, particularly tee-to-green. The course is known for its difficult off-the-tee and approach challenges, making Strokes Gained: Off-the-Tee (SG:OTT) and Strokes Gained: Approach (SG:APP) crucial. The greens are difficult, which adds pressure on putting, though the around-the-green game is less of a differentiator due to its relative ease. Players who can handle these challenges, especially those with strong recent form, should excel.

**Key Factors:**
- SG: Off-the-Tee and Approach are critical due to course difficulty
- Putting will be a differentiator given green complexity
- Recent form and momentum are important due to course demands
- Course fit emphasizing precision over power

**Players to Watch (AI sees edge):**

| Player | Adjustment | Edge |
|--------|------------|------|
| Scottie Scheffler | +3.0 | Exceptional recent form and strong course fit make him the standout favorite. |
| Collin Morikawa | +2.0 | Elite ball-striking abilities suit this course well, and he has strong recent momentum. |
| Hideki Matsuyama | +2.0 | His combination of form and hot momentum make him a strong contender at a course demanding precision. |

**Players to Fade (AI sees risk):**

| Player | Adjustment | Reason |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Xander Schauffele | -3.0 | Despite a good course fit, recent cold momentum makes him a riskier option this week. |
| Rory McIlroy | -3.0 | Cold momentum and recent form are concerning despite a decent course fit. |

## AI Recommended Bets

| Player | Bet Type | Odds | Stake | Confidence | Reasoning |
|--------|----------|------|-------|------------|-----------|
| Hideki Matsuyama | FRL | 2500 | 3 units | high | Matsuyama ranks #2 in the composite model and has strong recent form and momentum. His course fit is solid, and the high EV on FRL suggests a significant mispricing in the market. His precision with approach shots fits well with Riviera's demands, enhancing this bet's appeal. |
| Scottie Scheffler | FRL | 900 | 2 units | high | Scheffler is the top-ranked player in the composite model and comes into the tournament with excellent form and momentum. His SG: Off-the-Tee and Approach are exceptional, making him a strong contender for FRL given the course's challenges. The high EV and strong form justify this position. |
| Collin Morikawa | Top 5 | 500 | 2 units | medium | Morikawa ranks #3 in the composite model with a well-rounded game that suits Riviera's demands. His form and momentum are both strong, and the model sees a positive EV in the top 5 market. His precision, especially on approach, aligns well with the course requirements. |

**Portfolio Notes:** The portfolio includes three players with diversified bet types, focusing on FRL and top 5 markets. Total exposure is spread across different outcomes, minimizing overlap in risk. Hideki Matsuyama and Scottie Scheffler have significant FRL potential, while Morikawa's top 5 bet balances the risk.

**Passing On:** I passed on the outright and top 20 markets despite positive EV due to higher potential returns on FRL and top 5 bets, aligning with the course's demands and players' strengths. The top 10 market was not selected due to lower relative EV compared to other opportunities.

**Total Units:** 7 | **Expected ROI:** High, given the substantial positive EV in selected markets.
