## AI Analysis

**Course Narrative:** The Riviera Country Club is known for its demanding layout, with a particular emphasis on strong ball-striking skills. The course demands precision off the tee and into the greens, given the very difficult SG:OTT and SG:APP conditions. The relatively easier around-the-green conditions suggest that players who can navigate the difficult approach and off-the-tee challenges will have the best chance to excel. Putting remains a challenge, adding to the premium on ball-striking over short game recovery.

**Key Factors:**
- Strong ball-striking: Emphasis on SG:OTT and SG:APP due to course difficulty.
- Form and momentum: Current form, particularly in recent rounds, will be crucial given the tough conditions.
- Course fit for difficult conditions: Players who excel in difficult scoring conditions should have an advantage.
- Avoidance of big mistakes: With difficult approach and tee conditions, minimizing errors will be key.

**Players to Watch (AI sees edge):**

| Player | Adjustment | Edge |
|--------|------------|------|
| Scottie Scheffler | +3.0 | Exceptional form and warming momentum align well with the course's demands. |
| Hideki Matsuyama | +2.0 | Hot form and strong course fit, particularly in ball-striking, position him well. |
| Collin Morikawa | +2.0 | Despite cold momentum, his strong course fit suggests potential upside. |

**Players to Fade (AI sees risk):**

| Player | Adjustment | Reason |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Viktor Hovland | -3.0 | Cold momentum and less favorable course fit on a demanding setup. |
| Rory McIlroy | -2.0 | Currently cold momentum and potential for big mistakes could be costly here. |

## AI Recommended Bets

| Player | Bet Type | Odds | Stake | Confidence | Reasoning |
|--------|----------|------|-------|------------|-----------|
| Hideki Matsuyama | Outright | 2200 | 1.5 units | high | Hideki Matsuyama has an excellent composite ranking (#2) with strong recent form and momentum. His SG:OTT and SG:APP skills are well-suited to Riviera's demands, and the model shows a significant positive EV on his outright win odds, marking this as a high-confidence bet. |
| Hideki Matsuyama | Top 5 | 450 | 1.5 units | high | Matsuyama's high model probability for a top 5 finish aligns with his strong form and course fit. The positive EV and his hot momentum support a high-confidence bet in this market as well. |
| Hideki Matsuyama | Top 10 | 210 | 1.5 units | high | Given Matsuyama's solid track record and the model's high probability for a top 10 finish, this bet also carries significant positive EV. His high form and course fit scores bolster confidence in his ability to perform well here. |
| Hideki Matsuyama | Top 20 | -120 | 2 units | medium | While offering a smaller return, the top 20 bet on Matsuyama is still positive EV, reflecting his strong likelihood of performing steadily at Riviera. This bet is a safer position with high probability according to the model. |
| Scottie Scheffler | FRL | 900 | 1 unit | medium | Scheffler's excellent form and ball-striking capabilities make him a strong contender for first round leader. The positive EV suggests value, though first-round leader bets carry inherent volatility, warranting a medium confidence rating. |

**Portfolio Notes:** The portfolio is heavily weighted towards Hideki Matsuyama due to his strong model scores and consistent edge across different markets. This concentration carries risk if he underperforms, but the high confidence in his form and course fit justifies this approach. Scottie Scheffler's FRL bet adds some diversification.

**Passing On:** Passing on other players and bets due to lower model probabilities and less favorable EVs. The focus is on high-confidence, positive EV opportunities.

**Total Units:** 7.5 | **Expected ROI:** High, due to multiple high EV bets on Matsuyama across different markets.
