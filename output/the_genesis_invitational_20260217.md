## AI Analysis

**Course Narrative:** The Riviera Country Club is renowned for its challenging layout, demanding strong tee-to-green skills, particularly in driving and approach play. The difficulty in Strokes Gained: Off-the-Tee and Approach suggests players who excel in these areas will have an advantage. The easy Around-the-Green conditions might neutralize short game specialists, while the difficult putting conditions will test even the best putters. Historically, players who can manage their game strategically and handle pressure on the greens tend to perform well.

**Key Factors:**
- Strokes Gained: Off-the-Tee
- Strokes Gained: Approach
- Putting under pressure
- Strategic course management

**Players to Watch (AI sees edge):**

| Player | Adjustment | Edge |
|--------|------------|------|
| Scottie Scheffler | +3.0 | Outstanding recent form and strong course fit enhance his top-ranked composite score. |
| Hideki Matsuyama | +2.0 | Excels in difficult SG:APP environments, matches well with Riviera's challenges. |
| Collin Morikawa | +2.0 | Despite cold momentum, his SG:APP is elite, which suits this course's demands. |

**Players to Fade (AI sees risk):**

| Player | Adjustment | Reason |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Rory McIlroy | -3.0 | Cold momentum and less optimal course fit despite high baseline skill. |
| Xander Schauffele | -2.0 | Cold momentum and lower composite score compared to typical performance. |

## AI Recommended Bets

| Player | Bet Type | Odds | Stake | Confidence | Reasoning |
|--------|----------|------|-------|------------|-----------|
| Hideki Matsuyama | FRL | 2500 | 0.8u | high | Matsuyama has strong recent form and momentum, with a hot streak in his performance metrics, making him a formidable contender for First Round Leader. His tee-to-green skills are well-suited for Riviera, and the high EV suggests significant value in this bet. |
| Scottie Scheffler | FRL | 900 | 1.0u | high | Scheffler is the top-ranked player in the composite model, excelling in form and course fit. His strong Off-the-Tee and Approach game aligns with Riviera's demands, and the high EV indicates a strong betting opportunity for First Round Leader. |
| Hideki Matsuyama | Top10 | 210 | 0.8u | medium | Matsuyama's combination of recent form and a favorable course fit make him a good candidate for a Top 10 finish. The positive EV supports a modest stake, with his skills aligning well with the course's challenges. |
| Si Woo Kim | Top5 | 550 | 1.0u | low | Si Woo Kim's hot momentum and decent course fit provide an outside chance for a Top 5. Although the EV is just above the threshold, his recent performances suggest he could overperform. |

**Portfolio Notes:** The portfolio is concentrated on Hideki Matsuyama and Scottie Scheffler due to their high EV opportunities, particularly for First Round Leader. Matsuyama receives the highest allocation, but within the 40% rule, due to strong expected value across multiple bet types. Si Woo Kim adds slight diversification with a low-confidence, low-stake bet. [Portfolio limits applied: max 40% per player, max 3u per bet. Adjusted total: 3.6u]

**Passing On:** Passed on some Top20 and Top5 bets with lower EVs and less compelling qualitative support, to avoid overexposure and maintain a tight, value-focused portfolio.

**Total Units:** 3.6 | **Expected ROI:** ~15%
