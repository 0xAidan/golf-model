## AI Analysis

**Course Narrative:** The Riviera Country Club is known for its challenging setup, particularly off the tee and on approach. With very difficult SG:OTT and SG:APP conditions, players will need exceptional ball-striking, especially in driving accuracy and approach precision, to succeed. The course's difficult putting conditions mean that even good putters might struggle, while the very easy SG:ARG conditions suggest that scrambling will be less of a differentiator than usual.

**Key Factors:**
- Driving accuracy and distance control due to difficult SG:OTT conditions
- Precision in approach shots due to difficult SG:APP conditions
- Resistance to putting volatility due to difficult putting conditions
- Form and momentum, particularly in recent tournaments, will be crucial

**Players to Watch (AI sees edge):**

| Player | Adjustment | Edge |
|--------|------------|------|
| Scottie Scheffler | +2.0 | Exceptional form and momentum, strong overall composite score. |
| Hideki Matsuyama | +2.0 | Excellent course fit and current form, suited for difficult conditions. |

**Players to Fade (AI sees risk):**

| Player | Adjustment | Reason |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Patrick Cantlay | -3.0 | Despite a high course fit score, current momentum is very low. |
| Xander Schauffele | -3.0 | Cold momentum could be detrimental in challenging conditions despite good course fit. |
