## AI Course Analysis

**Course Narrative:** The PGA National Resort's Champion Course presents a challenging test, particularly with its very difficult approach and off-the-tee difficulties. Players must excel in ball striking, specifically with their driving and approach game, to navigate the demanding layout. With putting also being a challenge, consistent short-game skills will be crucial for success. The correlation with other difficult courses suggests that players who have performed well on similar layouts may have an advantage this week.

**Key Factors:**
- Strong off-the-tee performance
- Excellent approach play
- Solid short game and putting
- Recent form and momentum

**Players to Watch (AI sees edge):**

| Player | Adjustment | Edge |
|--------|------------|------|
| Jake Knapp | +3.0 | Strong course fit and recent momentum suggests he could outperform expectations. |
| Min Woo Lee | +2.0 | Hot form and good course fit indicate he might perform better than his current ranking suggests. |
| Tommy Fleetwood | +1.0 | Consistent recent form and solid course fit make him a strong candidate, possibly underrated in the current odds. |

**Players to Fade (AI sees risk):**

| Player | Adjustment | Reason |
|--------|------------|--------|
| Russell Henley | -3.0 | Cold momentum and underwhelming recent form suggest he may struggle on this difficult course. |
| Cameron Young | -2.0 | Cold form and mediocre course fit indicate he may not be a strong contender this week. |
| Jordan Spieth | -1.0 | Despite hot momentum, his overall course fit and form might not align with the demands of this challenging layout. |
