# Cognizant Classic — Backdated Prediction Report
**Model Version:** v4.0 (Post-Overhaul)
**Report Generated:** 2026-02-28 (After R3)
**Predictions Made With:** Pre-tournament data only (no in-play information)
**Tournament Status:** R3 Complete — 2026-02-28 3:10 PM

## Executive Summary

This report compares what our overhauled model (v4.0) predicted **before the Cognizant Classic** against actual results through 3 rounds. All model scores, rankings, and value bets were computed using only pre-tournament data (DG simulations, rolling stats, course history, weather forecasts). No in-play adjustments were used.

## Critical Finding: Field Mismatch

> **18 of our top 20 ranked players were NOT in this field.** The Cognizant Classic is an alternate PGA Tour event — the major names (Scheffler, McIlroy, Schauffele, Morikawa, etc.) played elsewhere. Our model scored 183 players from the DG field API, but many were never confirmed starters. This inflates model rankings with phantom entries and is the #1 issue to fix: **field filtering must be stricter.**
